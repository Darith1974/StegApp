			This website is for the purpose of my final year project in hdip computing which is a "Windows Application
			for Secure Message Communication using Image Steganography”. Steganography is the process of hiding a message 
			in a file, usually a media file such as image or mp3.
			It will include a brief introduction to my project, steganography and how to use my application.

			<h2 class="default_h2">Introduction to Steganography</h2>
			
			<p class="special_p">
			Steganography (Listen) is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, 
			apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security
			through obscurity. The word steganography is of Greek origin and means "concealed writing" from the Greek
			words steganos (στεγανός) meaning "covered or protected", and graphei (γραφή) meaning "writing". The first
			recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography
			and steganography disguised as a book on magic. Generally, messages will appear to be something else: images,
			articles, shopping lists, or some other covertext and, classically, the hidden message may be in invisible ink
			between the visible lines of a private letter.

			The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that messages do not attract attention to themselves.
			Plainly visible encrypted messages—no matter how unbreakable—will arouse suspicion, and may in themselves be
			incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal.[1] Therefore, whereas cryptography protects the contents
			of a message, steganography can be said to protect both messages and communicating parties.

			Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, 
			electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document 
			file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their
			large size. As a simple example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of 
			every 100th pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet, a change so subtle that someone not specifically 
			looking for it is unlikely to notice it.
			</p>
			<h2 class="default_h2">Introduction to Project</h2>
			
			<p class="special_p">
			This is my proposed project. It will outline primarily one technique for users of modern telecommunications
			to pass messages securely by making it extremely challenging for any person or group/organisation to suspect
			that a message is been passed and to procure that message. The primary technique to be explored will be 
			steganography which is a process whereby a message is embedded within a image and a recipient can retrieve that
			message generally by means of a specific algorithm/software plus a specific code or key. Also to be explored is
			the embedding of messages within other types of files: sound etc.
